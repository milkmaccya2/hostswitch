A simple CLI tool for switching hosts file profiles

[日本語](README.ja.md)

## Overview

HostSwitch is a CLI tool that makes it easy to switch between different hosts configurations for development and testing environments. Unlike GUI applications like Gas Mask, it focuses on quick command-line operations.

### Perfect for

- 👨‍💻 Web developers working with multiple development environments
- 🔧 Engineers who need to test across local, staging, and production
- 🏢 System administrators managing multiple server environments
- 🚀 Anyone who prefers fast CLI operations

## Key Features

- ✅ **Multiple hosts profile management** - For development, staging, production, etc.
- 💾 **Automatic backup** - Saves current hosts before switching
- 🎨 **Colorful output** - Clear status visibility
- ⚡ **Simple CLI** - Easy-to-remember commands
- 🔒 **Safe operations** - Explicit sudo requirements
- 🎯 **Interactive mode** - User-friendly prompts when run without arguments

## Requirements

- Node.js 20.0.0 or higher
- macOS / Linux / Windows (WSL recommended)
- sudo permissions (for hosts file switching)

## Installation

### Install from npm (Recommended)
```bash
# Global installation
npm install -g @milkmaccya2/hostswitch

# Or run directly with npx
npx @milkmaccya2/hostswitch list
```

### Install from source
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/milkmaccya2/hostswitch.git
cd hostswitch

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build TypeScript source
npm run build

# Global installation (optional)
npm link
```

## Usage

### Interactive Mode
```bash
# Run without arguments for interactive mode
hostswitch

# Navigate with arrow keys, select options with Enter
? What would you like to do? (Use arrow keys)
❯ Switch profile (current: local)
  List all profiles  
  Create new profile
  Edit profile
  Delete profile
  Exit
```

### List profiles
```bash
hostswitch list
# or
hostswitch ls
```

### Create a profile
```bash
# Create with default content
hostswitch create development

# Create from current hosts file
hostswitch create production --from-current
```

### Switch profile (auto-sudo)
```bash
# No need to type sudo manually - it will automatically rerun with sudo if needed
hostswitch switch development
# or
hostswitch use development
```

### Show profile contents
```bash
hostswitch show development
# or
hostswitch cat development
```

### Edit a profile
```bash
hostswitch edit development
```

### Delete a profile
```bash
# Delete with confirmation flag (required for safety)
hostswitch delete development --force
# or
hostswitch rm development --force
```

## Common Use Cases

### Development Environment Setup

```bash
# For local development
hostswitch create local
hostswitch edit local
# 127.0.0.1 api.myapp.local
# 127.0.0.1 app.myapp.local

# For Docker environment
hostswitch create docker
hostswitch edit docker
# 172.17.0.2 api.myapp.docker
# 172.17.0.3 db.myapp.docker

# Switch between them
sudo hostswitch switch local
```

### Team Development

```bash
# Reference team member's environment
hostswitch create team-dev --from-current

# Switch back to your environment
sudo hostswitch switch local
```

### Production Testing

```bash
# Create hosts pointing to production
hostswitch create production
hostswitch edit production
# 192.168.1.100 api.myapp.com
# 192.168.1.101 app.myapp.com

# Run tests
sudo hostswitch switch production
# After testing
sudo hostswitch switch local
```

## Development

### Building from source
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build TypeScript
npm run build

# Watch mode for development
npm run build:watch

# Run in development mode
npm run dev -- list
```

### Code Quality
The project uses **Biome** for linting and formatting:

```bash
# Check for linting errors
npm run lint

# Auto-fix linting and formatting issues
npm run lint:fix

# Format code only
npm run format

# Check formatting without fixing
npm run format:check

# Run linting + formatting + tests (recommended for CI)
npm run check
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run tests in watch mode
npm test

# Run tests once
npm run test:run

# Open test UI
npm run test:ui

# Generate coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

```

### Architecture

The application follows a clean architecture pattern:
- **Domain Layer**: Pure business logic in `HostSwitchService`
- **CLI Layer**: Command handling and user interaction
- **Infrastructure Layer**: File system, logging, and process execution
- **Dependency Injection**: All dependencies are injected via interfaces

This design enables:
- Easy unit testing with mocked dependencies
- Clear separation of concerns
- Platform-agnostic core logic
- Future extensibility (e.g., GUI or API interfaces)

## Troubleshooting

### Why sudo is required

The `/etc/hosts` file is a system file owned by root, so administrative privileges are required to modify it.

```bash
# ✅ Correct usage
sudo hostswitch switch dev

# ❌ Will error
hostswitch switch dev  # Permission denied
```

### Profile not found

```bash
# Check profile list
hostswitch list

# Check for typos
hostswitch show <tab>  # if bash completion is available
```

### Windows Usage

For Windows, we recommend using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux). If using native Windows, run Command Prompt as Administrator.

**Note**: Native Windows support has been improved. The tool now automatically detects the Windows hosts file location (`C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`).

## Data Storage

- Profiles: `~/.hostswitch/profiles/`
- Backups: `~/.hostswitch/backups/`
